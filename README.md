# Eventlock ‚Äì Your Local Events Companion

Eventlock is a mobile events platform that helps users discover local events, view their schedules, and register for them. Users can ‚Äúlock‚Äù events to revisit later in the MyEvents page, giving them a personalized dashboard of the events they've signed up for.
